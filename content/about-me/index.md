Hello, thanks for finding my page. I am a senior data engineer based in Leeds, UK.
I enjoy long walks, playing sports, playing games and taking names.

## A Little About Me

{{ resize_image(path="about-me.jpg", width=0, height=350, op="fit_height") }}

Fortunately, 2020-21 led to the unforseen benefit of having some free time,
so I decided to put together a simple website with no tracking or ads that
I can use as a blogging platform to share my thoughts on things from time to time.
If you would like to do the same, please reach out and I can show you how.

It costs me around Â£5 a month to have my own domain, site, and email address (not managing that on my own).
Stop being a taker on the internet and create your own page to push back
against all the massive companies leading us to the same ten websites!

```python
def thank_visitor(name: str) -> str:
    print(f"Thanks for visiting {name}!")
    when = "again"
    return when
```
