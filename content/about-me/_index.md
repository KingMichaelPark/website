![me](about-me.jpg)

Fortunately, 2020-21 led to the unforeseen benefit of having some free time,
so I decided to put together a simple website with no tracking or ads that
I can use as a blogging platform to share my thoughts on things from time to time.
If you would like to do the same, please reach out and I can show you how.

It costs me around Â£5 a month to have my own domain, site, and email address
(not managing that on my own).
Stop being a taker on the internet and create your own page to push back
against all the massive companies leading us to the same ten websites!

### Secure Contact

If you need to send me something secure you can
send it to the email in my social links and

If you want me to send you something and know it's from me, I'll sign it with
