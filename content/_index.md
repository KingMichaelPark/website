Hello, thanks for finding my website. I am a senior data engineer currently
based in Leeds, United Kingdom. I'm a pretty easy going guy who can sometimes
be bothered to write down what's on his mind. Have a browse to see if anything
tickles your fancy. I will probably be writing about topics such as:

- Python
- Data Engineering
- NBA/Basketball
- Life
- Food
- Music
