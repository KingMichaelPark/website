I'm Michael, a Principal Data Engineer based in Leeds, United Kingdom. I'm an
easy going guy who can sometimes be bothered to write down what's on his mind.
I specialise in Python, SQL, Infrastructure as Code and various cloud tooling.
I love to hack around on different technologies and have worked with various
other languages throughout hobby projects and work. I am always happy to have a
chat or give advice so please reach out to me at
[work@mhpark.me](mailto:work@mhpark.me) if you think I can help or just fancy
a chat.

Have a browse to see if anything peaks your interest. I will probably be
writing about topics such as:

- Coding/CLI-Tools/etc... (yes I am that guy who uses `neovim`)
- NBA/Basketball
- Food
- Music
- Life

I currently work at [Hippo Digital](https://hippodigital.co.uk), if you want to
work with me and other great engineers please get in touch. (There is a
referral bonus for new work and new hires so if you want to split it, reach out
to me first 😉)
