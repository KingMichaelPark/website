Hello, thanks for finding my website. I am a senior data engineer currently
based in Leeds, United Kingdom. I'm a pretty easy going guy who can sometimes
be bothered to write down what's on his mind. Have a browse to see if anything
tickles your fancy. I will probably be writing about topics such as:

- Coding
- NBA/Basketball
- Food
- Music

If you need to send me something secure you can
send it to the email in my social links and
encrypt with [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age):
