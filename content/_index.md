Hello and thanks for finding my website. I am a principal data engineer based
in Leeds, United Kingdom. I'm a pretty easy going guy who can sometimes be
bothered to write down what's on his mind. Have a browse to see if anything
tickles your fancy. I will probably be writing about topics such as:

- Coding
- NBA/Basketball
- Food
- Music
