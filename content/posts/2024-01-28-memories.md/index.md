Years ago, I was looking through old photo collections of my youth.
Despite the happiness on my face, the people smiling
around me, there something missing, my father.

## The Realisation

A few years ago, my family finally got around to turning our old video recordings from
the small tapes that only played when plugged into the camera into digital copies. So I've watched them a few times now.

There were so many beautiful memories that I had with my brother and mother
both on video and as stills, but because my dad was always the one taking
the photos, I never got to see him as often as I wanted. I wish that I had the ability
to see more of his growth and development throughout the early years of my own. Thankfully, you can help yourself by helping others.

## The Solution

1. Ask people nearby to take pictures for you of the entire family so at least
   a couple of the ones in the bunch are of everyone you were with.

2. When I am in town, a walk, anywhere there are people taking photos of the people
   they are with, I always offer to go over and take a picture for them. I do this
   with couples, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, whoever. The looks on their
   face (typically the dad's) is always one of immense thanks. It feels good to see 
   that you are making a positive impact (as selfish as that may be).

The point is to help them get what I always wanted growing up. The whole picture.
