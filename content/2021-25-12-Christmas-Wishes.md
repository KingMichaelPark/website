My goals for 2022 are nothing out of the ordinary; apart from having some of
them be to actually travel somewhere of relatively far distance in a hopefully
more open world. The main goal that should hopefully help drive the rest is
**optimism**

## The Ease of Being a Cynic

Conversations I have had over the past six years really seemed to stem around
the time that it was clear that the 45th President had been decided and that
Brexit was indeed taking place despite the odds that I thought made either
happening impossible. I won't get into how I feel about either of those
situations and the seemingly endless repurcussions that have snowballed from
these moments in time, apart from one, optimism.

Maybe it's just my own bubble but so many conversations that I have had over
the past five years have divolved into complaining about *something*. Whether
it was the 400th ridiculous thing that was said by a president, or whether it
is talking about the weather. Everything is a controversy and we - probably the
more liberal leaning side of the political spectrum but it happens on both
sides for different reasons - exhaust ourselves with endless moaning about
issues that we cannot solve in a coffee shop or a pub.

It is so easy to shoot something down. Enjoying an unusually warm day can be
done quite easily without brining up climate change, but people do it, why? We
all know that there are serious issues that are unlikely to improve overnight
(unless the world collectively decides to stop consuming significantly), we
don't need to be reminded endlessly in moments of otherwise bliss. It's like
when the MLB uses pink bats to raise awareness for breast cancer. (Of which the
cynic in me immediately already wants to pile onto that charity for its
misappropriation of charitable funds received). We know that cancer exists and
that it is awful and that we wish desperately to cure the world of it. Does it
really need to enter our minds on a 3-2 pitch in the bottom of the 9th?

Therefore, my personal goal for next year is to try to put the troubles of the world
out of my head at least half the time I would otherwise open my mouth to utter some
retort to a political speech or a reminder that factory farming exists if I see
someone buying the KFC chicken bacon steak whatever burger. There are undoubtedly
behaviours that we can all improve upon to help future generations, but remember that
its okay to be greedy sometimes and enjoy life for yourself. You needn't be so selfless
that you become bitter and wave your fist at the sky.

That said, don't be overly selfish and pretend that getting a covid booster
only affects you. I'm speaking in general terms. Get vaccinated so we all have
a much better chance of living our best lives as soon as we can.

It will be a struggle to try to overcome these things (at least personally, I have this
strange issue with letting things go sometimes), just remember to let the thought pass
and get back to enjoying life's little momemnts instead of tearing them down.

	Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
	Other things just make you swear and curse
	When you're chewin' on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle
	And this'll help things turn out for the best

	And always look on the bright side of life
	Always look on the light side of life

	If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
	And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
	When you're feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
	Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

	And always look on the bright side of life
	Come on, always look on the bright side of life

	For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
	You must always face the curtain with a bow
	Forget about your sin, give the audience a grin
	Enjoy it it's your last chance anyhow

	So always look on the bright side of death
	Just before you draw your terminal breath

	Life's a piece of shit when you look at it
	Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
	You'll see it's all a show keep 'em laughing as you go
	Just remember that the last laugh is on you

	And always look on the bright side of life
	Always look on the right side of life
	Come on Brian, cheer up

	Always look on the bright side of life
	Always look on the bright side of life
	Worse things happen at sea you know

	Always look on the bright side of life

	~ The Life of Brian, Monty Python
